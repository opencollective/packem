# Code Splitting

The `import()` ECMAScript proposal by Domenic Denicola allows dynamically loading modules. It is currently in stage 3 of the [TC39 process](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/).

> Support for dynamic imports in Packem using the `dev-plugin` is early. Refer to the issues section of the [`packem-plugins`](https://github.com/packem/packem-plugins.git) repo.

## Example

Just use `import()` directly in your code. For example, if you have two modules, _A.js_ and _B.js_, to dynamically import the latter into the former and log the output, this is how one could accomplish it:

```javascript
// B.js

export default {
  isAvailable: true
};
```

```javascript
// A.js

// Using ES6's Promise API:
import("./B").then(console.log);

// Using `async/await` syntax
const exportsOfB = await import("./B");

console.log(exportsOfB);
```

## Under the Hood

In Packem, a dynamically imported module retains its own sub-graph in the module graph. Hypothetically, a simple interface to represent a chain of dynamic imports would look something like this:

```typescript
export default [
  // In essence, Packem fails without the `root` field being defined
  // in the configuration file.
  {
    id: "root",
    // Root never gets a `bundle_id`
    dependencies: [
      // Module `sKAY2qXG` (mangled) is bundled with the root.
      "sKAY2qXG"
    ],
    ...
  },
  {
    id: "sKAY2qXG",
    // If `bundle_parent` corresponds to `root` then it's a regular
    // module.
    bundle_parent: "root",
    dependencies: [
      "yFj2CkjK", "vhjv3jjP", "zYqARjUK",
      "LPrhSMJz", "b34kURy3", "XnOhbVJ7"
    ],
    ...
  },
  {
    id: "yFj2CkjK",
    // This is a dynamically imported module that belongs to module
    // `b34kURy3`.
    bundle_parent: "b34kURy3",
    dependencies: [
      // Module `sKAY2qXG` (mangled) is bundled with the root.
      "sKAY2qXG"
    ],
    ...
  },
  ...
] as ModuleGraph;
```

Before Babel does any transformations, all `import()` statements are replaced with the mangled id. The serializer handles fetching of modules which is where the code splitting issue in `dev-plugin` originates from.
